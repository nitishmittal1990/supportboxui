­­­­Design problem :
————————————————
Let’s say we want to build a unified help widget for our SaaS product, which has these three options(design mockups are attached in the zip) : 
- Chat with a support agent 
- Write an email to support 
- Find the answer from help articles

Feel free to use UI libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap or any other UI library.

    
Assumptions : 
—————————————
 - Assume the “Live Chat” tab will be handled by some chat provider like Olark, so you could render some dummy content when a user switches to that tab. 
 - For the thumbnail icons in “FAQ” tab, you can use some placeholder icons (from Font Awesome, etc). ­­­­­­ 
     
It will be sufficient to build it as a prototype (you don’t need to handle file uploads, form submission and stuff). 

What we are looking for is the attention to detail, finish of the UI and the code quality. It would be great if we can get the exact look and feel as in the mockups. Making the experience even smoother by adding some CSS transitions, etc would be a plus! :)
